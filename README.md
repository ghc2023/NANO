## What is this?

NANO is a set of short-range / low-rez / low-altitude trained YOLOv8-nano detection and segmentation model that detect a few simple things in RGB imagery. They are pretty basic for now.

It's free to use so knock yourself out! Just make sure to follow the Ultralytics terms of service around commercial use (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) since this uses their code for training.

# Does it work?

Not bad... it's a nano model so it's super fast for your edge devices. See the video below.



The size of the neural network makes it pretty ineffective at longer ranges, which is expected.
